# Day 1 – Data is Everywhere: Introduction to Data Analysis

## Data is Everywhere!
We use or create data every day. How do we create this data? 🤔  

- Anytime you pick up your phone and look something up online  
- Stream music  
- Shop with a credit card  
- Post on social media  
- Use GPS to map a route  

All these activities generate data, which makes understanding and analyzing it important in our daily lives.

## What is Data?
Data is information or facts collected about something. It can be numbers, words, pictures, measurements, or observations.

**Examples:** 
- Age of students in a class
- Sales of products in a shop
- Daily temperatures

## What is Data Analysis?
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, and organizing data to find useful information and support decisions.

**Example:** 
- A shop can look at sales data to know which product sells the most and when

## Key Differences

### Data Science vs Data Analysis
- **Data Science:** A broader field that uses data to make predictions, build models, and solve complex problems. Often uses programming, machine learning, and statistics.  
- **Data Analysis:** A smaller part of data science, focused on inspecting, cleaning, and interpreting data to find insights or trends.

**Example:**  
- Data analysis → Checking sales data to see which product sells most  
- Data science → Using sales data to predict future sales and trends

### Data Analysis vs Data Analytics
- **Data Analysis:** The process of examining data to find useful information and insights.  
- **Data Analytics:** The application of data analysis to solve specific business problems. It is more action-oriented.

**Example:**  
- Data analysis → Calculating the average daily sales  
- Data analytics → Using those insights to decide on promotions or inventory management


# Day 2 – Types of Data

## Introduction
Not all data is the same. In data analysis, understanding the type of data you are working with is very important because it determines how you analyze and interpret it.

---

## 1. Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)

Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics. It is non-numerical and cannot be measured with numbers.

Examples:
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Eye color
- Country
- Marital status
- Product category

This type of data is grouped into categories.

---

## 2. Quantitative Data (Numerical Data)

Quantitative data consists of numbers and can be measured or counted.

Examples:
- Age
- Height
- Salary
- Number of students
- Sales revenue

Quantitative data can be analyzed using mathematical operations.

---

## Types of Quantitative Data

### a) Discrete Data
Discrete data can be counted. It usually consists of whole numbers.

Examples:
- Number of students in a class
- Number of cars in a parking lot
- Number of products sold

You cannot have 2.5 students — it must be a whole number.

---

### b) Continuous Data
Continuous data can be measured and can include decimals.

Examples:
- Height (5.7 ft)
- Weight (60.5 kg)
- Temperature (36.6°C)

Continuous data can take any value within a range.

## Why This Matters in Data Analysis

Understanding data types helps a data analyst:
- Choose the correct analysis method
- Create appropriate charts
- Apply correct statistical techniques
- Make accurate conclusions

Correct data understanding leads to better insights.
